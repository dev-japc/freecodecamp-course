# FreeCodeCamp Python Exercises

A collection of small Python exercises and example scripts created while following the FreeCodeCamp Python curriculum. Each script demonstrates a focused concept or small utility (OOP, validation, simple algorithms, and CLI-style examples). No external dependencies are required — plain Python 3.
